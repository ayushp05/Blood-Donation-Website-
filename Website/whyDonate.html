                It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle
                cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.

                There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time
                before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that
                safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.

                Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to
                donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red
                cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.

            Behaviours
        </h2>
        You must not give blood:

        If you engaged in “at risk” sexual activity in the past 12 months
        Individuals with behaviours below will be deferred permanently: 
        <br>
        1) Have ever had a positive test for HIV (AIDS virus)
        <br>
        2) Have ever injected recreational drugs.
        <br>
        3) In the national blood donor selection guidelines, there are more behavior eligibility criteria. Criteria could be different in different countries.

            Pregnancy and breastfeeding
        </h2>
        Following pregnancy, the deferral period should last as many months as the duration of the pregnancy.

        It is not advisable to donate blood while breast-feeding. Following childbirth, the deferral period is at least
        9 months (as for pregnancy) and until 3 months after your baby is significantly weaned (i.e. getting most of
        his/her nutrition from solids or bottle feeding).
